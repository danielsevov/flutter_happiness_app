    "dailyQuestionOneGuide": "This useful tool is designed to help you track and reflect on your emotional state. Here are some guidelines to help you assess your levels of the primary emotions Happiness, Anger, Fear, and Sadness:\n\n- Happiness: Think about what made you happy today. Perhaps you did something fun with friends or family, received a compliment at work, or finally completed a task you had been dreading. Reflect on what contributed to your happiness today and rate it on a scale of 0 to 10.\n\n- Anger: Think about what made you angry or frustrated today. Perhaps you had an unpleasant discussion with someone, were treated unfairly, or something didn't go as planned. Reflect on what contributed to your anger today and rate it on a scale of 0 to 10.\n\n- Fear: Consider what made you anxious or worried today. Perhaps you have an important deadline approaching, are concerned about your health, or had a stressful situation at work. Reflect on what contributed to your fear today and rate it on a scale of 0 to 10.\n\n- Sadness: Consider what made you sad today. Perhaps you received bad news, felt lonely, or were disappointed in yourself. Reflect on what contributed to your sadness today and rate it on a scale of 0 to 10.\n\nRemember that the purpose of this tool is to make you more aware of your emotional state and how it changes over time. Take the time to reflect on your emotions and rate them honestly to help you better understand and manage your feelings.",
    "dailyQuestionTwoGuide": "This question is intended to help you reflect on how you have taken care of yourself today. Here are some examples to help you answer the question:\n\n- Have you taken action on your personal to-do list? This can include things like completing a project you've been working on, making progress on a personal goal, or completing a household task that was on your to-do list.\n\n- Have you prioritized self-care today? For example, have you taken a power nap if you were tired, eaten well, drank enough water, or engaged in physical activity?\n\n- Have you taken steps to maintain a healthy work-life balance? This could include setting boundaries between work and personal time, taking breaks during the day, or scheduling time for yourself to relax.\n\n- Have you made time for yourself today? Have you done something you enjoy, spent time with loved ones, or just taken a few minutes to relax and recharge?\n\nRemember that the goal of this question is to help you focus on how you can take good care of yourself and prioritize your well-being. Take the time to reflect on your day and how you can make self-care a priority in your daily routine.",
    "dailyQuestionThreeGuide": "This question is intended to help you reflect on your day and think about the ways in which you have helped others. These can be simple (random) acts of kindness or more intentional efforts to assist others. Consider if you have helped someone without expecting anything in return or if you have done something positive for your community today, for example:\n\n- Have you offered to help a colleague with a project?\n\n- Have you held the door open for someone or let someone go ahead of you in the checkout line?\n\n- Did you do volunteer work today?\n\n- Have you picked up litter on the way home or helped an elderly person cross the street?\n\n- Have you made a donation to a charity or supported a friend in need?\n\nRemember that helping others doesn't have to be a grand gesture. Even small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone's day. Try to focus on the positive impact you have had on others, rather than the recognition or reward you may receive.",
    "dailyQuestionFourGuide": "This question is meant to help you reflect on what insights you gained today or what you learned about yourself. Here are some examples to help you with your answer:\n\n- Did you learn something about yourself that you didn't know before? This could be a new habit or behavior that you noticed or an awareness of your emotions or thought patterns.\n\n- Do you recognize a pattern in the things you do? This could be a repeated behavior or thought pattern that you noticed in yourself.\n\n- Did you make the right decisions based on intuition, arguments, or feelings? Are you aware of the potential consequences of this choice?\n\nRemember that the goal of this question is to help you focus on your personal growth and self-awareness. Take some time to reflect on your day and think about what you learned about yourself today.",
